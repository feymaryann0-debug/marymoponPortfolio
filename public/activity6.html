    <p>
        My name is Mary Ann Fey Mopon, an 18-year-old Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at Western Mindanao State University – Ipil Campus. I was born on <a href="./Activity3.html"> April 12, 2007</a>, and I currently live in M&J Dormitory
        in Lower Taway, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay. Originally from Labuyo, Gango, R.T. Lim, Zamboanga Sibugay, I am dedicated to building a better future through education and continuous self-improvement. for self-expression. I am noisy and childish when
        I am surrounded by people I am comfortable with but also I am opposite like nonchalant and don't talk when I feel like I am not okay with people around me.
    </p>

    <p>As a Computer Science student, I am passionate about learning how technology works and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring HTML and creating simple projects like portfolio websites and systems. I am constantly improving
        my skills step by step, making sure I understand both the basic and advanced concepts in programming and computing. Though this is not really my dream course but since I am already here I will gonna padayon nalang maybe this is where gyud my destiny
        is, chariz, I hope mani popcorn to strive for more and will not settle for a less cuz ako nato e.
    </p>

    <p>Beyond academics, I am a hardworking and determined person who believes in growth and perseverance. I value discipline, responsibility, and creativity in everything I do. My goal is to become successful in the field of technology and make my family
        proud while continuously developing my knowledge and skills in the world of computer science. Lastly is this, (smile before u read) I hope my instructor will not expect higher towards me because I am just relying to YT video tutorials on how to
        use html and still cannot able to make my own website because I am slow learner huhuhu hehehe this is for educational purpose only to add the sentence. That is all thank you for reading this I appreciate your time saur much because not everyone
        will give their time just to get to know me and I hope this is nabasa in english the water is falling. God Bless Us All.
